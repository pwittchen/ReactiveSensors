Usage
-----

Code sample below demonstrates how to observe Gyroscope sensor. 

Please note that we are filtering events occuring when sensor readings change with `ReactiveSensorFilter.filterSensorChanged()` method. There's also event describing change of sensor's accuracy, which can be filtered with `ReactiveSensorFilter.filterAccuracyChanged()` method. When we don't apply any filter, we will be notified both about sensor readings and accuracy changes.

```java
new ReactiveSensors(context).observeSensor(Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
    .filter(ReactiveSensorFilter.filterSensorChanged())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<ReactiveSensorEvent>() {
      @Override public void call(ReactiveSensorEvent reactiveSensorEvent) {
        SensorEvent event = reactiveSensorEvent.getSensorEvent();

        float x = event.values[0];
        float y = event.values[1];
        float z = event.values[2];

        String message = String.format("x = %f, y = %f, z = %f", x, y, z);

        Log.d("gyroscope readings", message);
      }
    });
}
```

We can observe any hardware sensor in the same way. You can check [list of all sensors in official Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html#sensors-intro). To get list of all sensors available on the current device, you can use `getSensors()` method available in `ReactiveSensors` class.

### Setting sampling period

Default sampling period for observable below is set to `SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL`.

```java
Observable<ReactiveSensorEvent> observeSensor(int sensorType)
 ```

We can configure sampling period according to our needs with the following observable:

```java
Observable<ReactiveSensorEvent> observeSensor(int sensorType, 
                                              final int samplingPeriodInUs)
 ```
 
We can use predefined values available in `SensorManager` class from Android SDK:
- `int SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST` - get sensor data as fast as possible
- `int SENSOR_DELAY_GAME` - rate suitable for games
- `int SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL` - rate (default) suitable for screen orientation changes
- `int SENSOR_DELAY_UI` - rate suitable for the user interface

We can also define our own integer value in microseconds, but it's recommended to use predefined values.

Example
-------

Exemplary application, which gets readings of various sensors is located in `app` directory of this repository. You can easily change `SENSOR_TYPE` variable to read values from a different sensor in a given samples.

If you are interested in library usage with Kotlin, check sample in `app-kotlin` directory.

Good practices
--------------

### Checking whether sensor exists

We should check whether device has concrete sensor before we start observing it. 

We can do it in the following way:

```java
if (reactiveSensors.hasSensor(SENSOR_TYPE)) {
  // observe sensor
} else {
  // show error message
}
```

### Letting it crash

We can let our subscription crash and handle situation when device does not have given sensor in `onError(throwable)` method implementation of the `Subscriber`. Other types of errors can be handled there as well.

```java
new ReactiveSensors(context).observeSensor(Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
    .filter(ReactiveSensorFilter.filterSensorChanged())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Subscriber<ReactiveSensorEvent>() {
          @Override public void onCompleted() {
            // subscription completed
          }

          @Override public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
            if (throwable instanceof SensorNotFoundException) {
              // device does not have given sensor - show error message
            } else {
              // handle other types of errors
            }
          }

          @Override public void onNext(ReactiveSensorEvent event) {
            // handle event
          }
        });
```

### Subscribing and unsubscribing observables

When we are using subscriptions in Activity, we should subscribe them in `onResume()` method and unsubscribe them in `onPause()` method.

### Filtering stream

When we want to receive **only sensor updates**, we should use `ReactiveSensorFilter.filterSensorChanged()` method in `filter(...)` method from RxJava.

When we want to receive **only accuracy updates**, we should use `ReactiveSensorFilter.filterAccuracyChanged()` method in `filter(...)` method from RxJava.

If we don't apply any filter, we will receive both accuracy and sensor readings updates.

### Other practices

See also [Best Practices for Accessing and Using Sensors](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html#sensors-practices).

Download
--------

You can depend on the library through Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.pwittchen</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactivesensors</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

or through Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.pwittchen:reactivesensors:0.1.2'
}
```

Tests
-----

Tests are available in `library/src/androidTest/java/` directory and can be executed on emulator or Android device from Android Studio or CLI with the following command:

```
./gradlew connectedCheck
```

Code style
----------

Code style used in the project is called `SquareAndroid` from Java Code Styles repository by Square available at: https://github.com/square/java-code-styles. Currently, library doesn't have checkstyle verification attached. It can be done in the future.

Static code analysis
--------------------

Static code analysis runs Checkstyle, FindBugs, PMD and Lint. It can be executed with command:

 ```
 ./gradlew check
 ```

Reports from analysis are generated in `library/build/reports/` directory.
